# Yt-Analyzer

Yt-Analyzer is a project that utilizes the Google YouTube API to fetch and display information about YouTube channels based on their channel IDs. This project provides a convenient way to gather data about multiple YouTube channels and visualize the collected information.
For playing with data I visualised data from different channels providing content on DSA & at the end gathered insights of videos from [Striver](https://www.youtube.com/@striver_79)  youtube channel :)
